1. @keyframes                  //Specify the Set of rules for animation

2. animation-name              //Set animation name

3. animation-duration          //For how long animation will occour

4. animation-delay             //After how much time animation will start
        ・Animation defines in minus value also

5. animation-iteration-count   //How many times animation will repeat
        ・Count maybe in number or 'infinite'

6. animation-direction         //Which direction animation will move
        ・Mainly 3 directions:
            ①alternate
            ②reverse
            ③alternate-reverse

7. animation-timing-function   //Specify the speed curv of animation
        ・ease      - slow/fast/slow (default curv)
        ・linear    - same speed from start to end
        ・ease-in   - specifies an animation with slow start
        ・ease-out  - specifies an animation with slow end
        ・easy-in-out   - specifies an animation with slow start and slow end
        ・cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Use to define custom values in cubic-bezier function

8. animation-fill-mode         //Helps to put on other element berfor or after playing animation
        ・none      - (Default) Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing
        ・forwards  - The element will retain the style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)
        ・backwards - The element will get the style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period
        ・both      - The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation properties in both directions.   

9. animation                   //Animation shorthand property
        ・systax:
            animation: animationName duration animation-timingfunction delay animation-iteration-count animation-direction
        ・Example:
            animation: example 5s linear 2s infinite alternate;
